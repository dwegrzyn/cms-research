———————————————————————————————————FLATFILE CMS RESEARCH——————————————————————————————————

*Automad (PHP)
- no online demo
- markdown editing 
+ browser-based GUI
+ more intuitive representation of data used by template (blanks to fill for page variables)
+ templates/themes can use page variables to fill in content
+ documentation
- limited community support (not many detailed tutorials, forums, etc)
+ simpler/cleaner file layout
- no pre-made themes besides default

Typesetter
+ includes themes (but quality/variety questionable)
- less grid flexibility
+ WSIWYG editor
- online demo available


Pulse
- costs $$$
+ mobile editor
- build with blocks
- not intuitive
- online demo available
- WSIWYG editor supposedly
- not sure how to have client just create pages based on template or something

*Grav (PHP)
- markdown editing
- uses Twig php templating engine 
+ various plugins available
+ admin dashboard plugin
+ existing themes / modifications
+ custom page variables
- no online demo
+ bigger community
+ good documentation
- more complex file layout than automad
- uses yaml “blueprints” (not sure exactly how these work)
+ “module” template allows pages to be built from templated sections (bootstrap style)


WonderCMS
+ in page editing
- not sure about consistent styling/theming
- not many plugins/themes
+ TINY (5 files)

razorCMS (PHP)
+ edit in page
- no online demo

Others:
Siteleaf
Statamic
Processwire - don't think this is flat-file
Anchor (PHP?)
	- only supports latest browsers
Cloud Cannon / Jekyll / Ruby
	- cloud-based
	- good editor for nontechs?

Grav/Automad already converting markdown to html with the php
- but how to alter the theming or templates?
- how to make sure structure works with the theme?

Seems like a lot of extra work to make something like Medicio/Moderna work with Grav/Automad
- basically have to make a new theme 
- which includes css but also php conversion, making templates, yaml, etc
- it’s supposed to be “easy” to convert html but don’t see much documentation for it
- update: better to do conversion with javascript so probably not considering automad/grav

1. what is “ideal” html? What needs to be done to abstract it and make it theme-able?
2. how to apply theme (“ideal” html -> js/css -> styled html)
3. how to make markdown into “ideal” html
